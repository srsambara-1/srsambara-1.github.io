  <p>
    Welcome to my site! I recently graduated from <strong>Harvard University</strong>, where I studied
    <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>History &amp; Science</strong>, and graduated
    <em>magna cum laude</em>, <strong>Phi Beta Kappa</strong>.
    My interests lie broadly in advancing machine learning methods for healthcare, with a particular
    focus on developing multimodal AI systems that emulate clinical diagnosis and developing methods
    to enhance safe patient–AI interactions.
    Check out my research below.

  <h2>Research & Publications</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>RadFlag: A Black-Box Hallucination Detection Method for Medical Vision Language Models</strong><br />
      <em>ML4H @ NeurIPS 2024</em><br />
      Proposes a sampling-based, black-box method to detect hallucinations in medical vision–language
      models using entailment-based uncertainty estimation and conformal prediction.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models</strong><br />
      <em>Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2026 (Oral Presentation)</em><br />
      Introduces the first large-scale benchmark for grounded diagnostic reasoning over 3D MRI volumes,
      with region-specific supervision and evaluation metrics for localization and reasoning accuracy.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Evaluation of Large Language Models as Emergency Department Revisit Predictors</strong><br />
      <em>Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2026 (Oral Presentation)</em><br />
      Studies the use of large language models for predicting emergency department revisits and
      demonstrates performance gains using retrieval-augmented and embedding-based approaches.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Understanding the Use of Mobility Data in Disasters: Exploratory Qualitative Study of COVID-19 User Feedback</strong><br />
      <em>JMIR 2024</em><br />
      Examines public perceptions and concerns around the use of human mobility data during the
      COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for privacy-aware disaster response.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>MedRedFlag: Investigating How LLMs Redirect Misconceptions in Real-World Health Communication</strong><br />
      <em>Submitted to ACL 2026</em><br />
      Analyzes how clinicians redirect unsafe or false patient assumptions in practice and evaluates
      whether large language models appropriately correct or instead accommodate these misconceptions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Public Outreach & Leadership</h2>

  <p>
    I am passionate about public outreach and fostering critical conversations about healthcare and AI.
    I have served as a <strong>Harvard Student Leader in Artificial Intelligence</strong> and a
    <strong>United Nations Millennium Fellow</strong>, working at the intersection of technology,
    policy, and social impact.
    I was also the <strong>President of the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum</strong>, where I
    led programming and discussions on global health equity and emerging technologies, and a
    <strong>Managing Editor of the Harvard Political Review</strong>, where I edited long-form writing
    on science, policy, and ethics.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy singing <strong>Carnatic music</strong>, playing <strong>tennis</strong>,
    and <strong>running</strong>.
